# WIP boskos


## Background
[βοσκός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82) - shepherd in greek!

boskos is a resource manager service, that handles and manages different kind of resources and transition between different states.

## Introduction

Boskos is inited with a config of resources, one JSON entry per line, from `-config`

A resource object looks like
```
type Resource struct {
	Type       string    `json:"type"`
	Name       string    `json:"name"`
	State      string    `json:"state"`
	Owner      string    `json:"owner"`
	LastUpdate time.Time `json:"lastupdate"`
}
```

Type can be GCPProject, cluster, or even a dota2 server, anything that you want to be a group of resources.
Name is a unique identifier of the resource.
State is a string that tells the current status of the resource.

## Config update:
1. Edit resources.json, and send a PR.

1. After PR is LG'd, make sure your branch is synced up with master.

1. run `make update-config` to update the configmap.

1. Boskos updates its config every 10min. Newly added resources will be available after next update cycle.
Newly deleted resource will be removed in a future update cycle if the resource is not owned by any user. 

## Local test:
1. Start boskos with a fake resources.json, with `go run boskos.go -config=/path/to/resources.json`

1. Sent some local requests to boskos:
```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/start?type=project&state=free&owner=user'
```

## K8s test:
1. Create and navigate to your own cluster

1. `make deployment`

1. `make service`

1. `kubectl create configmap projects --from-file=config=projects`

1. `kubectl describe svc boskos` to make sure boskos is running

1. Test from another pod within the cluster
```
kubectl run curl --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
Waiting for pod default/curl-XXXXX to be running, status is Pending, pod ready: false
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
[ root@curl-XXXXX:/ ]$ curl 'http://boskos/request?type=project&state=free&owner=user'
