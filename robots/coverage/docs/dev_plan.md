# The development plan for open sourcing code coverage tool

The code coverage tool originally designed for Knative repos and is re-designed to be onboarded to Kubernetes repos. The code is broken up into several parts and the plan is here

1. Isolate the production of Junit XML (TestGridâ€™s input) from the coverage tool. Onboard that feature to Gopherage so that it can be run independently from the coverage tool. This part is completed in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/9887
   - further work: need Kubernete's team to make sure this tool is running as a job in post-submit and make sure TestGrid is configured to read from the right location
2. Create an isolated tool to calculate the difference of two coverage lists and produce a collection of individual coverage differences. The result is formatted optionally to a table in coverage bot post. This part is under review in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/10010. ETA Nov 27
3. Create an isolated tool to browse through a list of prow job build stored in GCS bucket and retrieve the coverage profile file stored in the latest successful build. ETA Dec 3rd
   - pre-req: We need to make sure post-submit job runs "go test -coverprofile" and produces the profile in artifacts. This part may need be completed by the Kubernetes team
4. Create a script to run the tool created in step 3 - the retrieved profile will serve as the base profile. Compare the new code coverage profile with the base profile, using the tool created in Step 2.
   - pre-req: before the script is run, the pre-submit job should have ran the "go test -coverprofile" and produced the new profile in artifacts. This part may need be completed by the Kubernetes team
5. Add a command to the above script to post the content (described in step 2) to corresponding Github PR. This part may need Kubernetes team's help to authorize a bot to do the posting
6. Need Kubernete's team to add the script to the post submit process
